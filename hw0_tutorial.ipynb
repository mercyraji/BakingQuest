Sorensen called\n[Parsley](http://www.memento-mori.com/parsely-products/parsely-pdf).\n\n\n<img src=\"tutorial-map.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n\n\n\nThe goal of this game is simple: help your character find some food to eat because they are hungry!","block_group":"562665be6d6e4a38893f3db9f082ffd4"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"1e91b98e6c76450dbd47cc339bd9f359","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## The Text Adventures Library\n\nWe will be using a framework designed for this class called _Text Adventures_, which is included in this repo.\n\n### High-Level\n\nThe main concepts we are concerned with when building a game with Text Adventures are:\n\n* Things: _locations, items, and characters_\n* Actions: things a character can do\n* Blocks: things that prevent a character from going somewhere\n* Commands: how a user interacts with the game\n\n### Things\n\n_Things_ can have _properties_. A property is some detail about the thing that influences how other things can interact with it. A poisonous potion might have the property `is_poisonous` set, or a locked door might have `is_locked` set. Properties are designed to be flexible and easily extensible without significant code changes.\n\n_Things_ can also have commands associated with them. A rosebush might have a command that lets characters pick a rose from the bush, and that rose might have a command for smelling it.\n\nAll _things_ are stored in `text_adventures.things`.\n\n### Actions\n\nAn action is something a user does to change the game's state, such as changing location, eating food, or attacking something.\n\nWhen a user enters a command, the game will parse the command to determine its intent and route it to the appropriate action. This means a user can type _go west_ and the game will work out that this means `text_adventures.actions.Go` and it will determine if the character can move west based on where the character is.\n\nThe game's state might change each time an action is executed, so action instances are created for each command and the game's state is re-evaluated to determine if the action will be successful or fail.\n\n### Blocks\n\nBlocks are useful for implementing things like a locked door or if some direction is guarded by a monster.\n\nIf a user attempts to enter a location that is blocked from where they are, the command will fail with some information about why. It's up to the game designer as to whether or not a block can be removed.","block_group":"35f51463e0284102b43e33b47624119f"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"formattedRanges":[],"cell_id":"0d056002dbbe4f66b3dc4701739cd7e4","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-h3"},"source":"### Install required libraries","block_group":"8e85a67367644564a7d6eee53674dd8f"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"7958d4a9","execution_start":1756843027419,"execution_millis":2869,"execution_context_id":"23b03909-f712-45f3-a602-e91fab9d1fd2","cell_id":"5143b0bda2024676b889abb08633dbb1","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"!pip install -r requirements.txt","block_group":"14de3ac223714a3ab5b9fbce98b19749","execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Collecting graphviz\n  Downloading graphviz-0.21-py3-none-any.whl (47 kB)\n\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m47.3/47.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m8.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: graphviz\nSuccessfully installed graphviz-0.21\n\n\u001b[1m[\u001b[0m\u001b[34;49mnotice\u001b[0m\u001b[1;39;49m]\u001b[0m\u001b[39;49m A new release of pip is available: \u001b[0m\u001b[31;49m23.0.1\u001b[0m\u001b[39;49m -> \u001b[0m\u001b[32;49m25.2\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m[\u001b[0m\u001b[34;49mnotice\u001b[0m\u001b[1;39;49m]\u001b[0m\u001b[39;49m To update, run: \u001b[0m\u001b[32;49mpip install --upgrade pip\u001b[0m\n","output_type":"stream"}],"outputs_reference":"dbtable:cell_outputs/c55163be-a41b-4ba3-a611-c9bab42f680b","content_dependencies":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"2f11cf9846944441b92a8d660a4011cf","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### Import Text Adventures","block_group":"5fb558c3ae454edbb27252ff39eccd78"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"fa5fedf1","execution_start":1756843033234,"execution_millis":207,"execution_context_id":"23b03909-f712-45f3-a602-e91fab9d1fd2","cell_id":"f41d55050df641a2953803bbe48604b9","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"from text_adventure_games import (\n    games, parsing, actions, things, blocks, viz\n)","block_group":"287d2c005fa449409081a16224d2b8f2","execution_count":13,"outputs":[],"outputs_reference":null,"content_dependencies":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"53ac7d0c1fdd447b943d83b236051073","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## Locations\n\nA location is a place that characters can go to.
