# Text Adventure Games!

This Python notebook builds a simple text advenutre game inspired by the
[Adventuron Classroom](https://adventuron.io/classroom/) design by Chris
Ainsley of Adventuron Software Limited.

The main components are:
1. __The parser__, which interprets the player's commands.
2. __The game__, which represents world (a collection of __locations__,
   __items__, and __characters__), and describes what the player sees.
3. __The data__, which you input to create your own unique game.

For this homework assignment, I have implemented most of a classic text
adventure game for you.  I marked a few places that you'll need to fill in your
own code in order to implement ACTION CASTLE!

You can download a PDF of the game from [Parsely: Preview n' Play Edition (this
contains a free copy the Action Castle game).](http://www.memento-mori.com/pdf/parsely-preview-n-play-edition)
